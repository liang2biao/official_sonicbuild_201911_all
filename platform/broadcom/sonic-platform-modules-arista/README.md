## License

All linux kernel code is licensed under the GPLv2. All other code is
licensed under the GPLv3. Please see the LICENSE file for copies of
both licenses.

## Purpose

This package contains kernel drivers, a python library and a python script to
provide platform support for Arista switches.

The `arista` tool will identify the platform on which it is running. It will then
load and initialize the kernel drivers. Once initialised, the system will expose
transceivers, leds, fans, temperature sensors and gpios through the sysfs.

## Supported platforms

The following platforms are currently supported,

 - DCS-7050QX-32
 - DCS-7050QX-32S
 - DCS-7060CX-32
 - DCS-7060PX4-32
 - DCS-7170-64C
 - DCS-7260CX3-64

Some platforms will require some custom kernel patches.
They are available on the Azure/sonic-linux-kernel repository.

## Usage

This repository contains both a `systemd` and `LSB` init script for startup and
shutdown integration with the operating system.

Alternatively the `arista` tool can be used in standalone to load and unload
the platform support.

```
   arista --help
```

Since the python library knows about the current platform, it can provides a
common and unified implementation of the SONiC plugins.
Currently supports `eeprom`, `psuutil`, `reboot`, `sfputil` and `led_control`.

All the python code is python2 and python3 compatible.

## Drivers

The kernel drivers in this repository are mainly tested against a 4.9 kernel.
They have previously been used with 3.16 and 3.18 kernels.

### scd-hwmon

The `scd-hwmon` is the current implementation for the `scd` and is being used on all
platforms.

When the `scd-hwmon` driver is loaded, the various gpios and resets can be set
and unset by writing into the sysfs file.
The meaning of `0` or `1` should be deduced based on the name of the sysfs entry.

```
cd /sys/module/scd/drivers/pci:scd/<pciAddr>/
# put the switch chip in reset
echo 1 > switch_chip_reset
```

## Components

This section describes how to interact with the various components exposed by
the kernel drivers.
In order to see them, the platform must be successfully initialized.

The following sections describe how to manually interact with the components.
Examples shown may differ across platforms but the logic stays the same.

### LEDs

LED entries can be found under `/sys/class/leds`. Since the sysfs interface
for LEDs is not very expressive, the brightness field is used here
to toggle between off and different colors. The brightness to LED
color mappings are as follows (0 maps to off for all LEDs):

```
status, fan_status, psu1, psu2:
  0 => off
  1 => green
  2 => red

beacon:
  1+ => blue

qsfp:
  1 => green
  2 => yellow

fan:
  1 => green
  2 => red
  3 => yellow
```

Given that this repository is primarily aimed at running on SONiC, an
implementation of the `led_control` plugin is available under
`arista.utils.sonic_leds`. It requires access to the `port_config.ini` file to
translate from `interface name` to `front panel port`.

### Fans

Fans are exposed under `/sys/class/hwmon/*` and respect the
[sysfs-interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface)
guidelines.

This repository provides the kernel modules to handle the fans.

### Temperature sensors

Temperature sensors are exposed under `/sys/class/hwmon/*` and also respect
the [sysfs-interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface).

They are all managed by linux standard modules like `lm73` and `max6658`.

### Power supplies

Power supplies and power controllers can be managed by the kernel's
generic `pmbus` module. Assuming the pmbus module was compiled into the
kernel.

Some power supplies may need kernel patches against the `pmbus` driver.

### System EEPROM

The system eeprom contains platform specific information like the `SKU`, the
`serial number` and the `base mac address`.

The way to read the system eeprom from a platform can differ from one SKU to the
other.
The most reliable way to get this information is by issuing `arista syseeprom`

In the case of SONiC the module `arista.utils.sonic_eeprom` provide the plugin
implementation.

### Transceivers - QSFPs / SFPs

Currently only platforms with QSFP+, SFP+ and OSFP ports are supported.
All transceivers provide 2 kinds of information.

#### Pins

The first piece of information is obtained from the transceiver physical pins.
 - OSFP: present, reset, low power mode, interrupt, module select
 - QSFP: present, reset, low power mode, interrupt, module select
 - SFP: present, rxlos, txfault, txdisable

These knobs are accessible under `/sys/module/scd/drivers/pci:scd/.../`
The name of the entries follow this naming `<type><id>_<pin>`
For example `qsfp2_reset` or `sfp66_txdisable`.

See [this section](#scd-hwmon) on how to use them.

#### Eeproms

The second piece of information provided by a transceiver is the content of its
`eeprom`. It is accessible via `SMBus` at the fixed address `0x50`. Some
transceivers also exist at other `SMBus` addresses like `0x51` and `0x56`.

On linux, an unoffical module called `sff_8436_eeprom` or `optoe` can handle such
devices.
The arista initialisation library takes care of loading the module for all the
transceivers.
They should then all be available under
`/sys/module/sff_8436_eeprom/drivers/i2c:sff8436`

After instantiation, the EEPROM information can be read like so:

```
root@sonic# hexdump -C /sys/bus/i2c/devices/19-0050/eeprom

Before being read, the QSFP+ and OSFP modules must be taken out of reset and
have their module select signals asserted. This can be done through
the GPIO interface.

### QSFP - SFP multiplexing

On the `DCS-7050QX-32S`, the first QSFP port and the 4 SFP ports are multiplexed.
To choose between one or the other, write into the sysfs file located under
`/sys/modules/scd/drivers/pci:scd/.../mux_sfp_qsfp`

### GPIOs and resets

Most of the GPIOs are exposed by the `scd-hwmon` and the `sonic-support-driver`.
They should be available under `/sys/module/scd/drivers/pci:scd/.../`.
